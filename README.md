### Harry Potter App

In this application, data is fetched and listed using the [https://hp-api.onrender.com](https://hp-api.onrender.com) API. The **MVVM design pattern** and **Provider State Management** package were utilized for the structure.

For API calls, the **Dio package** was employed.

This is a test project where I aimed to implement clean architecture while performing API call operations.

Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown of the key features:

#### Key Features
- **API:** The app integrates the [Harry Potter API](https://hp-api.onrender.com) to retrieve data about characters and elements from the Harry Potter universe.
- **Design Pattern:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is the core design pattern, providing a clean and modular code structure.
- **State Management:** Provider is used for managing state across the app.
- **Networking:** All API calls are made using the Dio package, which simplifies HTTP requests and error handling.

#### Objective
The main objective of this project was to practice API integration and clean architecture using Flutter, following best practices in design and state management.
